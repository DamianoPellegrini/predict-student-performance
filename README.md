# Prediction of students' success using ML Techniques

This is my project for the "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence" course.

It is also my first every analysis of a dataset using machine learning.

The dataset used is the ["Student Performance Data Set"](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/697/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
